## Prosjektoppgave 2

This application was developed in Kotlin, and uses the Generic Game Service API
provided by our teacher. My application is an implementation of the game "Tic Tac Toe",
and allows users to play one on one against eachother online.

## How to play
Upon launching the application, a user has to click on of two buttons, these being
 "Create Game" and "Join Game". Upon clicking "Create Game" the user will be prompted to 
enter a username, and when confirmed, they will create a new game lobby, which shows a game ID
that you may share with another person, so that they can join. Joining is done by clicking 
the Join Game button, the user is then prompted to input their username, but also a game ID.

Once two users are connected to the game, the original lobby creator can start the game by 
clicking one of the squares, and place their mark. The goal of the game is to be the first one to get
three in a row, and when one of the players reach this goal the game ends. If there happens to be a draw
the application will recognize this as well.
